## Install

**This mod is designed for and tested on QSS-M and vkQuake engines.**

- Find your Quake install directory
- Download this [zipfile](https://github.com/whipowill/quake-mod-scarlet/archive/master.zip) and unzip to ``C:/path/to/quake/scarlet/``
- Make sure your ``C:/path/to/quake/id1/maps/`` folder has all your map files

See my other [repository](https://github.com/whipowill/quake-dir) where I've uploaded my Quake directory, which includes all the best multiplayer maps and waypoint files to use w/ Scarlet.  The reason I created this mod is so I can customize the game to my tastes, and this [file](https://github.com/whipowill/quake-dir/blob/master/scarlet/settings/custom.cfg) is where I make it happen.
